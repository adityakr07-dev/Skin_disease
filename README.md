Acne is characterized by the presence of whiteheads, blackheads, pimples, cysts, and nodules, primarily appearing on the face, forehead, chest, upper back, and shoulders. Treatment options include over-the-counter topical treatments such as benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. For more severe cases, prescription medications like retinoids and antibiotics may be recommended. Hormonal therapies, including oral contraceptives, can be effective for hormonal acne. Additionally, therapies such as laser and light treatments are available.

Actinic Keratosis presents as rough, scaly patches on sun-exposed areas like the face, ears, neck, scalp, chest, backs of hands, and lips. These patches may vary in color, appearing pink, red, or brown, and can be accompanied by itching, burning, bleeding, or crusting. Treatment options include cryotherapy (freezing the lesion), topical treatments like fluorouracil, imiquimod, or diclofenac, and photodynamic therapy. Regular monitoring is essential due to the potential progression to squamous cell carcinoma.

Benign Tumors are non-cancerous growths such as lipomas (soft, fatty lumps under the skin), sebaceous cysts, or dermatofibromas. They are usually painless and slow-growing. Often, no treatment is necessary unless they cause discomfort or cosmetic concerns. In such cases, surgical removal may be considered.

Bullous Diseases are characterized by fluid-filled blisters (bullae) on the skin and mucous membranes. Conditions under this category include bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus vulgaris. Treatment typically involves corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs to reduce inflammation and autoantibody production. Proper wound care and infection prevention are also crucial.

Candidiasis (Cutaneous) manifests as a red, itchy rash often occurring in warm, moist areas like the armpits, groin, and under the breasts. Satellite pustules may be present around the main rash. Topical antifungal creams such as clotrimazole or miconazole are commonly used. In severe cases, oral antifungal medications may be prescribed. Keeping the affected area dry and clean is essential to prevent recurrence.

Drug Eruptions are skin reactions that occur after medication use, presenting as rashes, hives, or blisters. The severity can range from mild rashes to life-threatening conditions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Immediate discontinuation of the offending drug is crucial. Supportive care and symptomatic treatment, including antihistamines and corticosteroids, may be provided. Hospitalization may be necessary in severe cases.

Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis) is characterized by dry, itchy, inflamed skin, often affecting the face, hands, elbows, and knees. The affected areas may ooze or crust over when scratched. Management includes regular use of moisturizers to maintain skin hydration and topical corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. Antihistamines can help alleviate itching. Identifying and avoiding triggers is also important.

Infestations/Bites result in skin reactions to insect bites or parasitic infestations (e.g., scabies, lice), including redness, swelling, itching, and pain at the site. In some cases, burrows or live parasites may be visible. Treatment involves topical or oral antiparasitic medications. Antihistamines and corticosteroids can provide symptom relief. Implementing preventive measures to avoid re-infestation is also essential.

Lichen Planus presents as purplish, flat-topped bumps, often appearing on the wrists, lower back, and ankles. Itching is common, and white lacy patches may be observed in the mouth. Topical corticosteroids are commonly used to reduce inflammation. Oral antihistamines can help alleviate itching. In severe cases, phototherapy may be considered.

Lupus (Cutaneous) manifests as red, scaly patches or ring-shaped lesions, often on sun-exposed areas. It may occur independently or be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Sun protection measures are crucial. Topical corticosteroids can reduce skin inflammation. For systemic involvement, antimalarial drugs like hydroxychloroquine may be prescribed.

Moles (Nevi) are small, dark brown spots caused by clusters of pigmented cells. They can appear anywhere on the body, are usually harmless, and may change over time. Most moles do not require treatment. However, if a mole changes in size, shape, or color, or becomes symptomatic, it should be evaluated by a dermatologist. Surgical removal may be performed for diagnostic or cosmetic reasons.

Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune condition that causes red, itchy, scaly patches, commonly on the knees, elbows, trunk, and scalp. Treatment options include topical treatments like steroid creams and vitamin D analogs, phototherapy (exposure to ultraviolet light), and systemic medications such as immunosuppressive drugs like methotrexate and biologics that target specific parts of the immune system.

Rosacea is characterized by facial redness, visible blood vessels, and sometimes small, red, pus-filled bumps. It commonly affects the central face and can flare up for weeks to months. Treatments focus on symptom control and may include topical and oral medications such as antibiotics and anti-inflammatories. Laser therapy can reduce redness and visible blood vessels. Identifying and avoiding triggers, such as spicy foods, alcohol, and extreme temperatures, is also important.

Seborrheic Keratoses are noncancerous skin growths that appear as brown, black, or light tan lesions with a waxy, scaly, slightly elevated appearance. They commonly occur on the head, neck, chest, or back. Treatment isn't typically necessary unless the lesions become irritated or are cosmetically concerning. Removal options include cryotherapy (freezing), curettage (scraping), or electrocautery (burning with an electric current).

Skin Cancer includes several types such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. These cancers can present as new or changing skin lesions, such as a growing bump, a sore that doesn’t heal, or a mole that changes in size, shape, or color. Basal cell carcinoma often looks like a pearly or waxy bump, squamous cell carcinoma may appear as a firm red nodule or scaly patch, and melanoma is typically an irregularly shaped, multicolored mole. Treatment varies based on the type and stage but generally includes surgical excision, cryotherapy, topical chemotherapy, radiation, or targeted biological therapies. Early detection greatly improves outcomes.

Sun/Sunlight Damage, often referred to as photodamage or photoaging, results from prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Symptoms include fine lines, wrinkles, dark spots (hyperpigmentation), rough skin texture, and, in severe cases, precancerous lesions like actinic keratoses. Chronic sun exposure can also lead to skin thinning and telangiectasia (visible blood vessels). The primary treatment involves prevention with regular use of broad-spectrum sunscreen, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding peak sun hours. Treatments for existing damage include topical retinoids, chemical peels, laser therapy, and antioxidant serums.

Tinea refers to a group of fungal infections of the skin, commonly known as ringworm. It includes tinea corporis (body), tinea pedis (athlete’s foot), tinea capitis (scalp), and tinea cruris (groin). These infections present as red, scaly, itchy patches that may have a ring-like appearance with central clearing. Tinea pedis often causes scaling and fissures between the toes. Treatment involves antifungal creams such as clotrimazole, terbinafine, or ketoconazole. For more extensive or resistant infections, oral antifungal medications like griseofulvin or fluconazole may be necessary. Good hygiene and keeping skin dry are important to prevent recurrence.

Unknown/Normal is a classification often used in diagnostic systems where the skin lesion observed does not fit any pathological pattern or may represent a benign, non-threatening condition. In many dermatological image databases or AI systems, “unknown/normal” may serve as a placeholder when the system is unsure of the diagnosis or when the skin appears healthy. If this is a clinical concern, dermatological follow-up is recommended for definitive assessment. No treatment is necessary unless symptoms develop or a clear diagnosis is later determined.

Vascular Tumors are abnormal growths originating from blood vessels, the most common being hemangiomas and pyogenic granulomas. Hemangiomas are often present at birth or appear in infancy as red or purplish raised lesions, typically on the head or neck. Pyogenic granulomas are small, red, fast-growing bumps that bleed easily. Treatment may not be needed for infantile hemangiomas unless they impair vision, breathing, or feeding; in such cases, beta-blockers like propranolol are effective. Pyogenic granulomas may require surgical removal or laser therapy if they cause symptoms or bleeding.

Vasculitis is an inflammatory condition affecting blood vessels, leading to a variety of skin findings including red or purple spots, ulcers, or nodules. It can affect small, medium, or large vessels and may present with systemic symptoms like fever, joint pain, or organ involvement. Cutaneous vasculitis often appears as palpable purpura (raised red-purple spots) on the legs. Treatment depends on severity and underlying cause, ranging from corticosteroids and immunosuppressants for systemic disease to supportive care for limited skin involvement. Identifying and managing underlying triggers, such as infections or autoimmune diseases, is key.

Vitiligo is a condition where the skin loses its pigment cells (melanocytes), resulting in irregular white patches on various parts of the body. These patches are usually asymptomatic but can cause emotional or psychological distress. The exact cause is unclear, but it is believed to be autoimmune-related. Treatment aims to restore pigmentation and may include topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors, phototherapy (narrowband UVB), and depigmentation therapy for extensive cases. Cosmetic camouflage and psychological support can be beneficial.

Warts are benign skin growths caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). They are contagious and can appear anywhere but are most common on the hands, feet (plantar warts), and face. Warts have a rough surface and may have tiny black dots (clotted blood vessels). They often resolve on their own but can be treated for cosmetic or comfort reasons. Treatment options include salicylic acid preparations, cryotherapy (freezing), laser therapy, and immunotherapy. Persistent warts may require more intensive dermatological care.
